Hi! Here's what you need to know to help localize Epicinium:

## 1: Argument placeholders
Occurrences of `%s` or `%d` in the English key are argument placeholders which must be kept intact. These placeholders are replaced by the game with a username, a number or sometimes another piece of translated text. Each key containing one or more placeholders has a description of what its arguments are. The arguments need to appear in the same order as they appear in English.

## 2: Capitalization
Please respect the capitalization (if applicable in your language) of words as they appear in English. For example unit types ("Rifleman", "Tank") are capitalized and certain buttons are all lowercase ("ok", "cancel") whereas others are all uppercase ("SETTINGS", "QUIT").

## 3: Punctuation
Please preserve punctuation as it appears (or does not appear) at the end of the key in English.

## 4: Length
As much as is feasible, try to keep the translations roughly the same visual length as the English translations.

## 5: Terms
There is a list of Terms available to help translate in-game terms consistently. Each Term also has a corresponding key. Once these keys are translated, their translations will be added to the list of Terms.
