# Release 0.23.1 (2018-05-25)

### Content
- Updated the tutorial to match the gameplay changes introduced in 0.23.0.

### Visuals & User Interface
- Made a higher definition version of the title screen logo.
- The camera now rests longer before showing a tile being captured to make it more clear what is happening.
- Slightly tweaked the registration procedure to comply with GDPR.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the camera could jerk to the side for no reason at lower framerates.
- Fixed a bug where a player leaving a game in progress and rejoining as an observer would cause that player to always receive gameplay updates about that game even if they were not in that lobby anymore and even if they were playing a different game.
- Fixed a bug where the server would finish a game at full speed when one player disconnected and one player resigned.
- Fixed a bug where a locked lobby could appear unlocked.


# Release 0.23.0 (2018-05-21)

### Accounts
- Slightly changed the way the score you obtain during a match affects your rating. Every match you play where you obtain a score higher than your current rating now causes your rating to increase by a percentage of the difference, but at least 0.1. Every match you play where you obtain a score lower than your current rating causes your rating to decrease by a percentage of the difference, but at least 0.1.
- Lowered the rating increase percentage for free-for-all matches involving at least two human players to 1% per human player, down from 10%. Lowered the rating decrease percentage for these matches to 1%, down from 10%.
- Lowered the rating increase and decrease percentages for matches versus AI players to 1%, down from 10%.
- While your rating is below 10, the rating increase percentage is at least a minimum percentage; this minimum scales from 10% at a rating of 0 through 5% at a rating of 5 down to 1% at a rating of 10.

### Gameplay
- Added the **Militia** unit. Its maximum size is 5 and it has a movement speed of 3. Each figure of a Militia unit deals 1 damage and has only 1 hitpoint. It can be produced by City and Farm tiles for a cost of 5.
- The Rifleman unit is no longer produced by City or Farm tiles, but instead by Barracks tiles for a cost of 5.
- The Tank unit can no longer attack and must rely on its Shell ability to deal damage.
- While a tile is occupied by an enemy unit, the tile cannot execute any orders except Stop orders and does not gain power or generate income at night.
- At the end of the decay phase, if all City tiles controlled by a player are occupied by enemy units, that player loses control of those City tiles and is defeated.
- When a player is defeated, their tiles and units lose all old orders.
- Tiles can now be given an order to produce a unit at an adjacent space. When the unit is produced, it will move to that space if possible. If a friendly unit is occupying the producing tile, the produced unit will bypass that unit to get to its destination. The produced unit will not attack if its destination space is occupied by an enemy unit, but it can be subject to an attack of opportunity if it is not bypassing a friendly unit.

### Content
- All maps have been adjusted by replacing the starting Rifleman units with  Militia units.
- Added the maps *oasis3ffa* and *beetle4ffa* back to the map pool.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where vision was not calculated properly, which could result in invisible units or units leaving behind ghosts when disappearing in the fog of war.

### Technical
- When a user attempts to reconnect after a crash, the server might believe that they are still online. Instead of rejecting the attempt, it will now be put on hold for a few moments until the old connection has been dropped.


## Hotfix 0.22.1 (2018-05-14)

*This is a server-only hotfix that is compatible with release 0.22.0.*

### Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue that caused the server to freeze for several minutes when a player disconnected unexpectedly.

### Technical
- Lowered the server-side connection timeout to 2 minutes, down from 10 minutes.


# Release 0.22.0 (2018-05-12)

### Gameplay
- When a unit performs a bypass attack past an entrenched unit and an enemy unit retaliates, the entrenched unit is no longer involved in the resulting damage step.
- All players receive an announcement whenever global warming crosses a threshold, i.e. whenever another 20% of the map is covered by chaos.
- Reenabled fog of war by default, except in the tutorial.

### Content

### Visuals & User Interface
- Joining a match in progress is now instantaneous.
- In the Winter growth phase, Snow also appears on tiles in the fog of war whose last known humidity is high enough.
- The chaometer has been removed in favor of a newspaper; this newspaper appears whenever global warming crosses a threshold. The last issue of the newspaper can also be brought back by clicking the date in the bottom left.

- In Fullscreen Desktop mode, no resolution can be specified because it will be the same as the user's desktop.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where a Trenches tile would provide its defense bonus during the retaliation attack that takes place when a unit performs a bypass attack past an entrenched unit.
- Added a missing delay between the sound effects of unit figures dying as a result of Death.
- The UPDATE button is now properly disabled while downloading a patch.
- Fixed a bug where certain particles would only render at scale 2.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a compatibility issue that caused the game not to start on certain Linux distributions due to differences in libcurl.


# Release 0.21.0 (2018-04-26)

### Content
- Added the maps **small3ffa**, **small4ffa** and **small8ffa**. Unlike the old free-for-all maps whose size scaled with the number of players, these maps are roughly the same size as the *small1v1* map. The chaos thresholds now scale with the size of the map instead of with the number of players, so expect a lot of global warming on these maps.
- Removed the maps *oasis3ffa* and *beetle4ffa* from the map pool.

### Visuals & User Interface
- When an order is given to a unit or tile, the order appears below that unit or tile and floats to the order list.

- Added an in-game panel that displays which player goes first each round.
- Orders can be rearranged by clicking and dragging them. (**Issue #1**)

# Release 0.9.0 (2017-12-04)

### Gameplay
- The **Town** tile replaces the Settlement tile. The Town tile can have up to 5 buildings, generates income and can produce Settler units, but cannot produce Rifleman units.
- Added the **Farm** tile. The Farm tile can produce Settler units and can turn all tiles around it into **Soil** tiles. In the growth phase, a Soil tile transforms into a **Crops** tile if the temperature and humidity support plant growth. The Crops tile is consumed in the night phase, generating 1 income for its owner and turning back into a Soil tile. Soil tiles and Crops tiles leave Dirt behind when destroyed.
- The Settler unit no longer builds Settlement tiles. Instead, it can settle either a Town tile, a City tile or a Farm tile.
- The City tile no longer generates income.
- Barracks and Industry tiles require nearby City tiles to grow, and thus no longer benefit from nearby Settlement/Town tiles.
- City tiles and other structure tiles now start with 1 power when they are created, instead of 0.
- Increased the cost of City tiles to 20, up from 10.
- Decreased the cost of Barracks and Industry tiles to 2, down from 5.
- Decreased the starting income to 20, down from 50.
- City tiles and other structure tiles now leave **Rubble** behind when destroyed, instead of Stone. Rubble cannot be built upon.
- Desert can no longer be built upon.
- Added **Ridge** tiles. Ridge tiles function the same as Mountain tiles except they are not as cold by default.
- In the spring growth phase, Grass no longer regrows from Dirt.
- Increased the maximum temperature at which trees and crops will grow to 39 degrees, up from 29 degrees.
- Reduced randomness in the starting values of temperature and humidity so they are more reliable.
- A Rifleman unit now always succeeds when capturing a tile, regardless of its size.
- When a tile produces a non-Settler unit, the tile now loses all of its power, not just 1.

### Content
- Reworked the maps *toad1v1*, *spruce1v1* and *small1v1* to be less cold and less humid by replacing some Water and Mountain tiles with Ridge tiles.
- Removed the maps *peaktorn1v1* and *snowcut1v1* from the map pool.

# Release 0.8.0 (2017-11-23)

### Accounts
- The game will ask you for a username the first time you log in with version 0.8.0 and automatically log you in with that username afterwards. To log in with that username on a different computer, you need to copy the *.acc* file from the *accounts* folder. To log in as a different user, you need to override the username in the settings.
- The server now tracks **rating points** for each player. All players start with 0 rating points. Every game you play causes you to gain rating points if the score you obtain at the end is higher than your rating, and lose points if your score is lower.

### Gameplay
- Tank units now deal trample damage to tiles when they move onto them, turning Grass to Dirt and destroying trees. A Tank unit with three tanks can even bring down buildings.
- Lowered default humidity from 65 percent to 55 percent.
- Lowered the maximum temperature at which grass and trees will grow from 39 degrees to 29 degrees.

- Fixed a bug where night phase mood indicators (e.g. pink hearts) were not displayed in observer mode and replay mode.
- Fixed a bug where disconnected observers could not rejoin the lobby if it was private.

### Technical
- The game is now able to patch itself. If a patch is available, the connection icon in the top right of the main menu will show an exclamation mark. Clicking this icon will cause the game to download the necessary files. Once the download is complete, clicking the icon again installs the patch and restarts the game.
- In AI vs AI games and replays, the server now waits between action phases until all observers have finished animating.
- Improved the responsiveness of rejoining a match in progress.
- Improved the stability and responsiveness of replay mode.
- Improved resolution detection when resolution is not specified in the settings. (**Issue #23**)
