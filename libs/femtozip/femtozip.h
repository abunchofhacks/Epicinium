/**
 * A simple C API to the FemtoZip compressor and model building functionality.
 * The basic recipe for using femtozip is to:
 *
 * 1. Collect sample "documents" (document is simply a byte buffer) which
 *    can be used to build a model.
 * 2. Call fz_build_model with callbacks which can be used by the model
 *    builder to retrieve the documents as needed.
 * 3. Call fz_save_model with the new model.
 * 4. Release the model via fz_release_model.
 * 5. Later (perhaps in a different process), load the model via fz_load_model.
 * 6. compress/decompress documents via fz_compress/fz_decompress
 * 7. fz_release_model the model when it is no longer needed.
 *
 * For a simple C example, see example.c in the source distribution of FemtoZip
 * at http://github.com/gtoubassi/femtozip
